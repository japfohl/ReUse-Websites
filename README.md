# Getting Started

### Starting a Development Server

* To start the development server on the locahost, enter the `public_html` directory.
```
Websites $ cd public_html
```
* From here, you can start the application and API by just running the bundled PHP development server. More info on the PHP development server can be found [here](http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php).
```
public_html $ php -S localhost:8001
```
Where 8001 can be any unused port number.
